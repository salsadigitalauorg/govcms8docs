# Adding a remote video in a field

GovCMS out of the box suports adding remote videos from sources like YouTube and
Vimeo in fields:

1. From the admin toolbar, navigate to: Content >> Add media >> Remote Video
2. Use the "Name" field to add a title for the video as you would like it to
   appear on your site (could be the same as the title of the video in the
   remote source)
3. Copy the link to the video, and paste it in the "Video Url" field
4. Click "Save"

# Embedding a remote video into content via the rich text editor

GovCMS out of the box does not support adding remote videos from within the rich
text editor; *additional configuration is required to enable this feature*. Some
sites might already be configured to allow this for certain user roles. Here's
how to do so:

1. From the admin toolbar, navigate to Content >> Add content
2. Select a content type
3. Add a title for your content
4. In the "Body" field, click the "Video Embed" button -> a dialog will pop up
5. Copy the link to the video, and paste it in the "Video Url" field
6. Click "Save" to close the "Video Embed" dialog
7. Scroll down the page and click "Save" to save the content

You can embed video in existing content the same way. Simply edit the content,
and repeat steps 4 to 7 above.

# Adding a remote video in a field

GovCMS out of the box suports adding remote videos from sources like YouTube and
Vimeo as a field:

1. From the admin toolbar, navigate to: Content >> Add media >> Remote Video
2. Use the "Name" field to add a title for the video as you would like it to
   appear on your site (could be the same as the title of the video in the
   remote source)
3. Copy the link to the video, and paste it in the "Video Url" field
4. Click "Save"

# Embedding a remote video into content via the rich text editor

Although GovCMS out of the box does not support adding remote videos from within
the rich text editor, some sites might already be configured to allow this for
certain user roles. To do so:

1. From the admin toolbar, navigate to Content >> Add content
2. Select a content type
3. Add a title for your content
4. In the "Body" field, click the "Video Embed" button -> a dialog will pop up
5. Copy the link to the video, and paste it in the "Video Url" field
6. Optionally, you might consider disabling the "Autoplay" option, as some
   people find it annoying/intrusive to have a video autoplay when the page
   loads.
7. Click "Save" to close the "Video Embed" dialog
8. Scroll down the page and click "Save" to save the content

You can embed video in existing content the same way. Simply edit the content,
and repeat steps 3 to 8 above.
